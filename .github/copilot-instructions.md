# Instructions for Copilot

The idea of this project is to create a set of documents for the Ramla Company that will help them in their operations. The documents should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

Also the documents have a todo list pages that contain tasks that need to be completed. The tasks should be specific and actionable for the projects we have.
